Welcome to our cross-pwgame platform

This is the front-end for our application, available locally, via a git clone, and soon on Expo Go

If you want to run it locally, just :
    - Clone the project
    - Install dependencies with npm install
    - Change the url to 'http://localhost:3000', in [src/core/Socket.js](src/core/Socket.js) if you wish to connect to a server you are running locally (https://github.com/nath-btx/cross-pwgame-back)
    - Start the server with npm start
    - Then connect either your browser, or your phone to Expo to run the app (some features might be misssing on web browser, we recommend to run it on your phone)
    - Enjoy the app :)
